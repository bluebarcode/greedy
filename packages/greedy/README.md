# Get Greedy!

This library provides

- deep
- typed
- null safe
- Ahead of time (?)

data retrieval **and** data manipulation aswell as data **consistency** in complex Typescript data structures.

## Wait what?

Imagine i18n keys or _paths_. ItÂ´s some kind of AOT data retrieval mechanism. But instead of strings - you can use it for everything in a datastructure. And you get type support in the making of your _paths_ aswell as in dataretrieval. Also you can pass in variables - so the retrieval is dynamic! Also you can not only read from, but also write to these _paths_.

## Examples

For now please check the unit tests in the "test" folder on GitHub!
